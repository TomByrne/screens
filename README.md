An experimental project to generate iOS and Android UI Layouts from a common source.

Currently it transforms a common XML layout file into several platform specific XML files.

The end goal is to use fairly abstract language when describing a layout so that platforms can use their own visual standards.
This means that the initial XML would most likely be describing 'intentions' rather than explicit layouts.
